        Advantages and Disadvantages of Travelling
        As with many other things in life, there are both pros and cons to travel; ups and downs. Here, we explain the advantages and disadvantages of traveling to help you make up your own mind.</p>

Traveling can be educational
We all learn something from travelling, regardless of whether it's about culture, life or people in general. If nothing else, hearing others speak another language and seeing different cultures helps us realize how similar we all are in so many ways.
It is also good for self-development as we generally become more open minded and appreciate other people more when we travel.</div>

    Traveling can broaden your horizons
    Travelling gives us the chance to see things with our own eyes that normally we would never find out about if not from traveling; especially traveling out of our comfort zone (something I encourage everyone to do).
    
    Imagine not knowing the existence of ancient temples in Cambodia, Peru or Sudan just a decade ago!

    Traveling can help you speak a new language
    It's amazing how fast your language skills improve when you travel to new places! Speaking a new language or two is always good, and it's easier to learn a language when you're traveling.
    
    Now, I'm never going to say my Greek is perfect. It's actually quite terrible. But I can find one or two things on a menu if I have to!
